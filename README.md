# Temperature converter

> Rust programming language practice
 
 #### Description
 
 This program converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.
 
 #### Requirements
 
 Install Rust programming language by following the instructions found on [this page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
 
 #### Run the program
 
 Run with the command `cargo run`

#### How it works

When the program is run you are presented with two conversion options:

> 1: C -> F  
> 2: F -> C

Entering number 1 or 2 will determine what conversion will be performed.

Next, you will need to provide the temperature value to be converted.

Please note that not all values are valid which will be communicated by the program if the invalid temperature value is provided.

Valid temperature values for Celsius scale are `T > -273.15C`.

Valid temperature values for Fahrenheit scale are `T > -459.67F`.
